# Remote Health App

A remote health application designed to connect doctors with patients in rural areas. The app standardizes documentation uploads using Llama 3.2 (text and image processing), simplifies tests for patients, and uses embeddings to match patients with the best doctors based on their test results. Doctors can communicate with patients via webcam for consultations.
